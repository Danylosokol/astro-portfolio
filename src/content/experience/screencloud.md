At ScreenCloud, a global digital signage provider partnered with Microsoft and Google, I worked across both product and marketing teams to build scalable applications and drive measurable business impact. I contributed to a unified backend platform powering over 100 integrations, migrating key apps like Slack and MS Teams to a shared API and resolving RSS duplication issues. I added accessibility features like auto-captioning for video content and improved performance across integrations used by 2,000+ daily users. On the marketing side, I led the development of 30+ core website pages and 50+ reusable components, boosting conversion rates by 30%, reducing CMS costs by $6,500/year, and improving performance by 25%. I also built a Stream Deck plugin enabling 20x faster content updates for a 100+ screen network, and launched a WordPress plugin delivering a 75% faster publishing experience. My work spanned a full-stack tech stack including Node.js, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, AWS, PHP, GraphQL, SCSS, and Prismic.
