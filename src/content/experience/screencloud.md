At ScreenCloud, a global digital signage provider partnering with Microsoft and ChromeOS, I developed key website pages that increased conversion rates by 30%. I implemented a cookie consent management solution, refactored website libraries and resolved complex dependency issues, improving Lighthouse scores by over 10 points. I also developed a Stream Deck plugin for a major client and created a WordPress plugin for Studio that allowed content to be posted directly to screens. My tech stack included JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, SCSS, Prismic, Theme UI, Vercel, GitHub, Figma, GraphQL, PHP, HTML and CSS.
